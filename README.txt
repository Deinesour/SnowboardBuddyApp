After clicking on the snowboard recommender option on the home page, it prompts you to enter your weight(lbs), height(cm), ability, and gender. 
If you aren't sure what your height is in centimeters is, the menu option in the top right corner that looks like a chart is a size chart
that will help you convert to cm. If you are in between one of the heights or weights, round up to the nearest one. Once you enter your size,
it will give you a list of recommended boards. 

After clicking on the weather option on the home page, it prompts you to enter the zipcode for the location of weather you are looking for, once you 
hit the button it plays "let it snow" since we all love a good pow day. Then it will display the temperature in farenheit and an overview of the weather.

The home page and size chart can be accessed from any page by clicking the icons in the top right corner.
